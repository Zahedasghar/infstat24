## Course Description:

This course provides an introduction to machine learning and related methods for big data from an economics perspective. Students will learn modern estimation methods for high-dimensional data, with a focus on causal inference and prediction problems in economics, business, and related fields. Through programming assignments and a final empirical project, students will apply machine learning techniques to real-world data.

## Learning Outcomes:

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

-   Apply machine learning methods to estimate causal effects in experimental and observational settings.
-   Solve prediction problems in economics using machine learning techniques.
-   Understand the uses, strengths, and limitations of machine learning for answering economic questions.
-   Implement machine learning algorithms using Python/R.
-   Analyze and interpret economic data using machine learning methods.
-   Conduct an empirical research project utilizing machine learning techniques.
