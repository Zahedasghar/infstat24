title: "Inferential Statistics"
---

# Course Description

In this course, you'll learn how to use statistical techniques to make inferences and estimations using numerical and categorical data. Students
are required to finish computer-based assignments. I wish that you learn stuff in this class in a way **learning** is fixed and
**timing** will be a *variable* but due to some regulatory issues, some hybrid model will be followed. Without active engagement, you will not
be able to learn well and perform good in the course. 

**Pre-requisite: Basic Statistics or special approval needed**

## Learning Objectives 

At the end of this course, the student should be able to: 

 -  Define and summarize research design and data collection principles and concepts.
 -  Create and interpret graphical data summaries.
 -  Calculate and interpret summary statistics.
 -  Calculate probabilities.
 -  Understand inferential statistics.
 -  Perform hypothesis tests for numerical and categorical data
 -  Calculate confidence interval for numerical and categorical data
 -  ANOVA

# Required Readings

```

1.  Christopher D. Barr, David M. Diez, and Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, OpenIntro Statistics Textbook by
Center for Open Education 
2.  David Freedman, Robert Pisani, Roger Purves, Statistics 4th Edition,John Wiley & Sons, New York.
3.  We will use the latest free version of: R Studio; You'll first need
    to download (R). JAMOVI/Excel in R is very user friendly way which will
    also be used.

# Course Policy

I will detail the policy for this course below. Basically, don't cheat
and try to learn stuff. Don't be that guy.

## Grading Policy

-   **25%** of your grade will be determined by a midterm exam.

-   **10%** of your grade will be determined by Quiz in class.

-   **15%** of your grade will be determined by your attendance and
    participation in class, and homework. Generally, ask questions and
    answer them.

-   **20%** of your grade will be determined by a 20-page term paper on
    when exactly "The Love Boat" jumped the proverbial shark. You will
    address whether this shark-jumping can be attributed to Ted
    McGinley, the introduction of Jill Whelan as "Vicki", or some other
    cause.

-   **50%** of your grade will be determined by a final exam.

## Attendance Policy

> Brickman](http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/06/10/showing-up/#note-6553-1)

Students should be weary of skipping class. I deduct *all* participation
points for a class after five unexcused absences and this can have
important implications for a student's overall grade in the class.

## Late Arrival of the Professor Policy

I will inform students via e-mail/others in advance of class if class is
cancelled for the day due to some unavoidable reason(s).

## E-mail/Social Media Policy

I am usually quick to respond to student messages sent through e-mails.
However, student other e-media messages are some times send messages
which dont need any response from my side and they can visit me in my
office hours.

## Make-Up Exam Policy

There are **NO** make-ups for missed exams. Don't bother asking.

## Academic Dishonesty Policy

Don't cheat. Don't be that guy. Yes, you. You know exactly what I'm
talking about too.
