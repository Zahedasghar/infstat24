This is R data which you can directly read in R.\nWe begin by loading the pakwheels data frame. Type the following in your console to load the data:\n\npakwheels &lt;- readRDS(\"D:/RepTemplates/infstat23/slides/pakwheels.rds\")\n\nThe data frame containing 56186 cars that shows up in your workspace is a data matrix, with each row representing an observation and each column representing a variable.

The names of these elements are user defined, like mean_dd, sd_dd, n, and you could customize these names as you like (just don’t use spaces in your names). Calculating these summary statistics also require that you know the function calls. Note that n() reports the sample size.\nSummary statistics:  Some useful function calls for summary statistics for a single numerical variable are as follows:\n\nmean\nmedian\nsd\nvar\nIQR\nrange\nmin\nmax\n\nWe can also filter based on multiple criteria.
