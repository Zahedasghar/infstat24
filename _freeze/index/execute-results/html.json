Gain experience in data wrangling and munging, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and effectively communicating results. Work on problems and case studies inspired by and based on real-world questions and data.  \n \n> Learn to spot nonsense and call it out. \n \nIn this course, you'll learn how to use statistical techniques to make inferences and estimations using numerical and categorical data. Students\nare required to finish computer-based assignments. I wish that you learn stuff in this class in a way **learning** is fixed and\n**timing** will be a *variable* but due to some regulatory issues, some hybrid model will be followed. Without active engagement, you will not\nbe able to learn well and perform good in the course. \n\n**Pre-requisite: Basic Statistics or special approval needed**\n\n## Learning Objectives \n\nAt the end of this course, the student should be able to: \n\n -  Define and summarize research design and data collection principles and concepts.\n -  Create and interpret graphical data summaries.\n -  Calculate and interpret summary statistics.\n -  Calculate probabilities.\n -  Understand inferential statistics.\n -  Perform hypothesis tests for numerical and categorical data\n -  Calculate confidence interval for numerical and categorical data\n -  ANOVA\n\n# Required Readings\n\n\n\n\n\n1.  Christopher D. Barr, David M. Diez, and Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, OpenIntro Statistics Textbook by\nCenter for Open Education \n2.  David Freedman, Robert Pisani, Roger Purves, Statistics 4th Edition,John Wiley & Sons, New York.\n3.  We will use the latest free version of: R Studio; You'll first need\n    to download (R). JAMOVI/Excel in R is very user friendly way which will\n    also be used.\n\n# Course Policy\n\nI will detail the policy for this course below. Basically, don't cheat\nand try to learn stuff. Don't be that guy.\n\n## Grading Policy\n\n-   **25%** of your grade will be determined by a midterm exam.\n\n-   **10%** of your grade will be determined by Quiz in class.\n\n-   **15%** of your grade will be determined by your attendance and\n    participation in class, and homework. Generally, ask questions and\n    answer them.\n\n-   **20%** of your grade will be determined by a 20-page term paper on\n    when exactly \"The Love Boat\" jumped the proverbial shark. You will\n    address whether this shark-jumping can be attributed to Ted\n    McGinley, the introduction of Jill Whelan as \"Vicki\", or some other\n    cause.\n\n-   **50%** of your grade will be determined by a final exam.\n\n## Attendance Policy\n\n\n\n> *Showing up is 80 percent of life* -- Woody Allen, [via Marshall\n> Brickman](http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/06/10/showing-up/#note-6553-1)\n\nStudents should be weary of skipping class. I deduct *all* participation\npoints for a class after five unexcused absences and this can have\nimportant implications for a student's overall grade in the class.\n\n## Late Arrival of the Professor Policy\n\nI will inform students via e-mail/others in advance of class if class is\ncancelled for the day due to some unavoidable reason(s).\n\n## E-mail/Social Media Policy\n\nI am usually quick to respond to student messages sent through e-mails.\nHowever, student other e-media messages are some times send messages\nwhich dont need any response from my side and they can visit me in my\noffice hours.\n\n## Make-Up Exam Policy\n\nThere are **NO** make-ups for missed exams. Don't bother asking.\n\n## Academic Dishonesty Policy\n\nDon't cheat. Don't be that guy. Yes, you. You know exactly what I'm\ntalking about too.\n\n\n# Class Schedule\n\nHere is that calendar but may change as per time table of School of\nEconomics.\n\n\n| Week    | Topic Covered                                         | Book Chapter |\n|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Week #1 | Introduction to types of studies                                         | OpenIntro and FM Ch.1          |\n| Week #2 | Introduction to data  | OI Ch1        |\n| Week#3  | Review of Probability + R/STATA/JAMOVI | OI Ch2 , FM Ch3       |\n| Week#4  | Review of Distribution of Random Variables                                | OI Ch3 +HW#1   |\n| Week#5  | Foundations of Statistical Inference                            | OI Ch4 +Quiz#1     |\n| Week#6  | continued                             | OI Ch4         |\n| Week#7  | continued                         | OI Ch4+HW#2   |\n| Week#8  |            Inference for categorical data            | OI Ch5       |\n| Week#9  | continued                       | SW7+Quiz#2     |\n|         | Mid Term Exam as per SOE date sheet                   |              |\n| Week#11 | Inference for numerical data                                 | OI ch6     |\n| Week#12 | continued                       | OI ch6        |\n| Week#13 | continued                                 | OI ch6        |\n| Week#14 | ANOVA and inference for linear regression                                         |OI ch6 & 7    |\n| Week#15 | Discussion of Empirical Study                        |              |\n| Week#16 | Wrap up                                               |              |\n\n: Tentative Schedule \n(Little variation maybe there as per topic/students need)\n\n",
