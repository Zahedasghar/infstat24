Distance from Martin Luther's birthplace: Wittenberg (Germany) place of Protestant Reformation

> The result: the closer counties were to the center of the Protestant
 movement, the higher their average incomes were—and the higher their
 literacy rates too. And after controlling for literacy rates, distance from
 Wittenberg no longer predicted higher income. To the extent that living near
 the origin of the Protestant Reformation raised people’s incomes, it was
 entirely attributable to gains in the ability to read and write.
